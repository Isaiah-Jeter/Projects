# Project Overview

### This is my implementation of a program that given two words, returns the minimum amount of edits needed to change one word to the other

## notes
- The importance of this program is found when using auto-correct on any device
- Knowing the minimum amount of changes neccesary can be used to both save time and to know the correct spelling of a word
