# Project Overview

During a hackathon at my school, I made a website that teaches users different popular methods for data encryption. The user is able to learn about Ceaser Cypher and RSA by first inputting a piece of data. The website then shows the user how the data is encrypted by encrypting the data step by step on the userâ€™s screen.
